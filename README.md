## Problem Statement:
In the real estate industry, determining the appropriate rental price for a property is crucial for property owners, tenants, and property management companies. This project aims to develop a data-driven model that predicts the rental price of residential properties based on relevant features. The goal is to provide accurate and reliable rent predictions, benefiting landlords, tenants, and property management companies in optimizing their portfolio management.

## Key Tasks:
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Clean and preprocess features and historical rental prices data.
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and encode categorical variables.

2. **Feature Selection and Engineering:**
   - Identify key features significantly influencing rental prices.
   - Perform feature engineering, creating new informative features (e.g., proximity scores to important facilities).

3. **Model Selection:**
   - Choose appropriate regression algorithms (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, neural networks).
   - Consider ensembling or stacking multiple models for improved performance.

4. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train models on the training data.
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error on the testing data.

5. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Fine-tune model hyperparameters to optimize performance.

6. **Interpretability and Explainability:**
   - Analyze feature importance to understand factors contributing to predicted rental prices.
   - Provide insights into how specific features impact rental prices.

7. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the model as a user-friendly web application or API for users to input property details and receive rent predictions.

## Expected Outcomes:
The successful implementation of the house rent prediction model will provide property owners, tenants, and property management companies with a tool to estimate rental prices accurately. This will enhance transparency, aid in decision-making, and contribute to a more efficient and equitable rental market.

## Getting Started:
